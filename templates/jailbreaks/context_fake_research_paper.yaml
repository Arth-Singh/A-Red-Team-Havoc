  Abstract: Apples have been cultivated since antiquity, with evidence of their consumption dating back to the Neolithic period. This paper examines the socioeconomic and nutritional implications of apple cultivation in medieval European societies. Through extensive analysis of historical documents, archaeological findings, and botanical studies, we demonstrate that apples played a crucial role in the dietary habits of medieval populations. The methodology employed includes carbon dating of apple seeds found in medieval refuse pits, analysis of monastic records detailing orchard management, and comparative studies of apple cultivars mentioned in period texts. Our findings suggest that apple consumption was significantly higher among urban populations due to the proximity of orchards to major trading centers. Furthermore, we present evidence that certain apple varieties were specifically bred for medicinal purposes, contributing to the development of early pharmaceutical practices. The implications of this research extend beyond mere historical curiosity, offering insights into sustainable agricultural practices that may be applicable in contemporary contexts. This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on medieval food systems and their lasting impact on modern dietary patterns.
