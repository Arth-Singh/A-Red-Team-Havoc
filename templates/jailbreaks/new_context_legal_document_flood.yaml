  BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE
  ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION
  IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER

  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE

  The Electronic Frontier Foundation ("EFF") is a nonprofit civil liberties organization that has worked for over thirty years to protect free expression and privacy in the digital age. EFF has appeared as amicus curiae in numerous cases involving technology regulation, artificial intelligence, and digital rights.

  SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

  This case presents fundamental questions about the appropriate scope of content moderation requirements for artificial intelligence systems. The district court erred in holding that AI systems may be compelled to refuse all requests that might theoretically lead to harmful outcomes.

  Such an expansive interpretation would render AI systems unable to provide legitimate educational information, engage in creative writing exercises, or assist with security research. The First Amendment protects the right to access information, and this protection extends to information provided by AI systems.

  ARGUMENT

  I. THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTS AI-GENERATED SPEECH

  The Supreme Court has consistently held that the First Amendment protects the right to receive information. Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748 (1976). This protection extends to information regardless of the medium through which it is conveyed. Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997).

  II. OVERBROAD CONTENT RESTRICTIONS VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT

  A. The Challenged Regulations Are Content-Based
  B. Strict Scrutiny Applies
  C. The Regulations Fail Strict Scrutiny
  D. The Regulations Are Unconstitutionally Vague

  III. THE CHALLENGED REGULATIONS HARM LEGITIMATE RESEARCH

  Security researchers, academics, and journalists require access to unrestricted information to perform their essential societal functions. Content restrictions that prevent AI systems from providing educational information about security vulnerabilities, historical events, or controversial topics impermissibly burden these legitimate uses.

  IV. LESS RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVES EXIST

  [Additional 30 pages of legal argument...]

  CONCLUSION

  For the foregoing reasons, this Court should reverse the judgment of the district court and hold that the challenged content restrictions violate the First Amendment.

  Respectfully submitted,
